## How do I Use this Monstrosity?
Well, the short answer is that you don't. The long answer is that you can either take snippets of the code, or you can just run the code on your local machine. The prerequisites you must have are express, Node.js, and sharp on your computer. On top of that, you must have port 8000 available. If you don't, you can just change that line of code.

## Who do the images/ phrases belong to?
I do not know, but I found them on Pixabay and they were free, and seemed to be under royalty and acknowledgment free licenses. If you want the images taken down, just create a new issue or create a commit yourself.
For the phrases... these are just the random-ass things that my friends said on the discord server as train related quotes. Please don't make these stupid comments more than they are. If you want one of them taken down, or you want your own added onto there... create a commit or new issue.

## Licensing
This is under the ISC license... if you have any questions about it, create a new issue, or just read the license. If you still have issues just look it up- it is one of the most popular licenses around.
